# Customer-Segmentation

This project involves segmenting bank customers based on their financial data to optimize marketing strategies. The dataset is cleaned, scaled, and analyzed using K-means clustering with the optimal number of clusters determined via the Elbow method. Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and autoencoders are applied to enhance segmentation. Customer clusters are interpreted to identify high-value groups, helping the bank target marketing efforts effectively.
